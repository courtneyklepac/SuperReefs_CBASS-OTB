This repository contains all things related to SuperReefs - a collaborative program between WHOI (Cohen lab), Stanford (Palumbi lab), and TNC to predict (WHOI), prove (Stanford), and protect (TNC) coral reefs with increased thermal tolerance. Here are the available resources to conduct a community-level multi-day heat stress exposure experiment.
